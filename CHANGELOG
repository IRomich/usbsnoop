2010: Graeme W. Gill <graeme@argyllcms.com>

	V 0.26g

	Added 64 bit driver support. As a result, the DDK needs to be
	used to build 64 bit USBSnoop, before the main application is built.

2008/12/13: Graeme M. Gill <graeme@argyllcms.com>

	V 0.23g

	Removed Win98 VxD driver, since DDK isn't available.

	Increased buffer in SnoopyPro/USBLogDoc.cpp GetNewURBSFromSniffer() line 205
	to avoid lockup with big USB packets.

	Bumped version number to 0.23G to label change.

	Fixed formatting slightly to make blank lines sane,
	and better deliniate each packet.

--/--/--:

	V 0.22
	
	Bumped version info to 0.22, fixed a bug in the exporter where it
	wouldn't take the filename selected as output file. Added XML output
	for isochronous transfers.

--/--/--:

	V 0.21

	Added export functionality. The only export format is XML for now, and
	only a very limited amount of information is exported for each URB.
	The selection of URB's is not implemented either, so trim down the log
	before invoking 'File', 'Export' to limit the amount of data exported.

--/--/--:

	V 0.20

	Added endpoint number as a column in the log.

	Added some analyzing log functionality: should figure out better
	which URBs are IN or OUT or INOUT and determines endpoint addresses

	Fixed isochronous IN transferbuffer handling: correctly gathers
	the individual buffers with the (variable) length

	Now adding the filter in front of the LowerFilters registry
	entry, so it's loaded first.

	Timestamping mess: should store plug-in stamp in front
	of trace and UI can either offset or not...
	-> allows comparison of timestamps across traces 

	Figure out why the update cmd ui in the devices dialog
	doesn't work... because the updatecmdui gets called on
	command invocation as well... doh

	sister device objects on newly arrived devices... wuah!

	V 0.13

	Added DumpBuffer() method to dump a buffer, with a call to KdPrint() per
	line, instead of per byte

	Added a PipeHandle/Endpoint matching table, which is used to display
    endpoint numbers instead of Windows PipeHandle

	Corrected display of URB_FUNCTION_SELECT_CONFIGURATION. Analize was wrong
    in case of several interfaces.
