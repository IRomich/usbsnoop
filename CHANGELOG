2010: Graeme W. Gill <graeme@argyllcms.com>

	V 0.26g

	Added 64 bit driver support. As a result, the DDK needs to be
	used to build 64 bit USBSnoop, before the main application is built.

2008/12/13: Graeme M. Gill <graeme@argyllcms.com>

	V 0.23g

	Removed Win98 VxD driver, since DDK isn't available.

	Increased buffer in SnoopyPro/USBLogDoc.cpp GetNewURBSFromSniffer() line 205
	to avoid lockup with big USB packets.

	Bumped version number to 0.23G to label change.

	Fixed formatting slightly to make blank lines sane,
	and better deliniate each packet.

	V 0.13

	Added DumpBuffer() method to dump a buffer, with a call to KdPrint() per
	line, instead of per byte

	Added a PipeHandle/Endpoint matching table, which is used to display
    endpoint numbers instead of Windows PipeHandle

	Corrected display of URB_FUNCTION_SELECT_CONFIGURATION. Analize was wrong
    in case of several interfaces.
